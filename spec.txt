I am the CEO of Chocolate Delights Inc., a wholesale chocolate business based out of Buffalo, NY. As our company approaches our 10th anniversary, we would like to improve our products and services. 
As such, we have reached out to all our customers asking them to fill out a survey. Now we would like to compile the data in a database so we can review it.
Our customers are from the tristate area. They have sent us their data of products purchased, the month/year it was purchased and their retail price. 




 I want the following reports:
1. The amount we sell of each product (in order of most popular to least popular)
2. Product details (item number, description, cost of production, wholesale price)
3. Which products brought in the most money
4. Which product brought in the least money
5. The peak month for each product
6. Which company brings in the most money
7. Which customer brings in the least  money
8. How much profit each customer makes on our products (assuming they sell everything)
6. How profit increased/decreased by year per item

Q: Do you have customers with more than one branch?
A: Yes. But none of them have two in one location

Q: From which date are you collecting data?
A: We collected data from the day of our grand opening- April 1, 2013 through February 1, 2023.

Q: How much profit do you make on each item? 
A: We sell our products at 20% markup

Q: What is the difference between wholesale and retail price?
A: Every company has their own amount. We do, however, insist that each item be at least 40% marked up so as not to harm our other customers.

Q: How do you determine product numbers?
A: They start from 1100 and as of today we have 87 products ( we are working on more)



I want to put the data in tables. I need: Company Name, location (city/town, state), email address, item number, item description, cost of production, wholesale price, retail price, amt purchased, date purchased ( I just want month and year)
